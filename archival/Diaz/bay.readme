To generate the sound:

 $ ngen bay.gen bay.sco
 (A lot of messages and warnings will be issued, you can safely ignore
 them) 

 $ csound -o devaudio -d -m0 bay.orc bay.sco

If you don't have ngen, you can use the bay.sco provided. It has been
processed to substract 7.5 to all start times of the notes, because
the first 7.5 seconds are silence (using the settings in bay.gen).

For details about the composition, read bay.gen and bay.orc
