CSOUND BENCHMARKS
=================

This is the first attempt at the creation of a small set of benchmarks.

There are currently 6 tests, three of which are repeated with different
options.

The files you need are the following ASCII files
bach.orc	bach.sco	risset1.orc	risset1.sco
guitar.orc	guitar.sco	james.orc	james.sco

and the two binary files pvtest.aif and lptest.aif

The files bench.bat and timer.exe are helper files for MSDOS, and bench.sh
is a similar script for unix.

1.  BACH	A short passage of Bach with a simple orchestra.

2.  RISSET1	A collection of complex instruments taken from the Risset set

3.  GUITAR	Modestly complex instrument, using builtin algorithms (pluck)

4.  JAMES	Very short 2 note section.

5.  PVANAL	Phase-vocoding analysis of a short file

6.  LPANAL	Linear-predictive coding of the same file


Please run the following scripts, recording elapsed time, and report the
times, machine and csound implementation.

csound -d 	bach.orc bach.sco
csound -m0 -d	bach.orc bach.sco
csound -g 	risset1.orc risset1.sco
csound -m0 -d	risset1.orc risset1.sco
csound -d 	guitar.orc guitar.sco
csound -m0 -d	guitar.orc guitar.sco
csound -g 	james.orc james.sco
pvanal pvtest.aif foo
lpanal lptest.aif foo

Please use whatever is the "natural" sound file format for your
machine (eg WAV on PC, AIFF on Mac and SGI etc).
