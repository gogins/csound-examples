; Even though csound only provides a limited number of stock gen subroutines,
; it includes one (gen 1) which can read in an external file.  Hence, you
; can use a standalone program to generate functions that aren't standard.
; In fact, as this example shows, you can use csound itself to create them.
; You just have to remember to perf with the floating point option (-f)...
;
; This orchestra will generate a bell-shaped function with max amp of 1.0 --
; required by endless.orc for an amplitude control function.
; Say "perf -f bellfunc.orc bellfunc.sco" to run it, then rename the output
; test.sf file to soundin.10 so that endless.sco can read it in via Gen 1.  rp
