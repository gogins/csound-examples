These are some of the example instruments I use in my beginning csound class
at The University of Texas at Austin School of Music.  Some of them require
soundin files, which are included -- they need to be placed in your SFDIR.
Some these instrument designs are quite trivial, written only to show how a
particular csound unit is typically used, but others are fairly complicated.
Probably none of them are "bullet proof."  Caveat emptor!
