<I><B>VMCI</B></I> (Virtual Midi Control Interface) <I><B>Plus</B></I> is
a shareware program which allows to send most MIDI data to a MIDI device
by means of gestural actions on the computer keyboard and mouse. VMCI Plus
is fully configurable and provides a total control of MIDI messages, even
without any MIDI interface card and without any external MIDI keyboard or
controller. This program is primarily designed to control real-time versions
of Csound (DirectCsound in particular), &nbsp;however it can also be used
with any internal or external MIDI device or computer programs such as
sequencers. It provides several panels with virtual sliders, virtual joysticks
and virtual piano-keyboard. The newer version of the program (VMCI Plus 2)
allows to change more than one parameter at the same time by means of the
new <B>Hyper-Vectorial Synthesis control</B>. VMCI supports 7-bit data as
well as the higher resolution 14-bit data that can be handled by the newer
versions of Csound.
<H4>
  VMCI Plus requirements:
</H4>
<UL>
  <LI>
    Windows 95 or NT.<BR>
  <LI>
    800x600 monitor resolution or higher (You can also use 640x480, but some
    windows might not displayed entirely). 1024x768 pixels are recommended to
    work comfortably with VMCI Plus.<BR>
  <LI>
    Though DirectCsound is optional (you can use VMCI also together with other
    programs such as sequencers etc.), the best of VMCI is reached when it is
    used together with DirectCsound itself. So be sure to have DirectCsound installed
    in your computer.<BR>
  <LI>
    A virtual midi Loopback device such as HUBI'S Midi Loopback, included in
    the package (thanks to Hubert Winkler). It is optional if you intend to control
    only external hardware MIDI instruments, but required when using Csound or
    sequencers.<BR>
  <LI>
    A fast computer&nbsp;(when DirectCsound is used at the same time in real-time;
    Pentium II or higher processors are recommended).
</UL>
<H4>
  VMCI Plus features:
</H4>
<OL>
  <LI>
    An arbitrary number of completely configurable&nbsp;<I><B>7-bit slider
    panels</B></I>. Each panel can handle up to 2048 controllers (16 MIDI channel
    X 128 controllers = 2048). The user can modify each controller by means of
    a slider. &nbsp;When moving a slider, a stream of MIDI control change messages
    are sent to the MIDI out port, according to slider position. Most sliders
    are hidden from current view, because a maximum of 64 sliders can be visualized
    at the same time in each panel (assuming the screen resolution is big enough).
    The user The number of visualized sliders can be adjusted by the user for
    each panel.<BR>
  <LI>
    An arbitrary number of completely configurable <B><I>14-bit slider</I></B>
    <I><B>panels</B></I>. Each panel can handle up to 1024 parameter. Similar
    to 7-bit slider panels, but offers a double data resolution. Each parameter
    is handled by means of two controllers, the first handling the most significant
    data byte, the second the less significant one. Up to 32 sliders can be
    visualized at the same time in each panel (assuming the screen resolution
    is big enough). The number of visualized sliders can be adjusted by the user
    for each panel.<BR>
  <LI>
    An arbitrary number of <I><B>7-bit virtual joystick</B></I> (mouse-sensitive
    areas) panels. It is possible to modify two parameter at the same time by
    dragging the mouse pointer inside a mouse-sensitive area. These areas are
    similar to the 'xyin' opcode of Csound. Each panel can handle up to 2048
    controllers. Up to 10 joystick areas can be visualized at the same time in
    each panel,&nbsp;handling 20 controllers. The number of visualized joystick
    areas can be adjusted by the user, for each panel.<BR>
  <LI>
    An arbitrary number of <I><B>14-bit virtual joystick</B></I> (mouse-sensitive
    areas) panels. &nbsp;Each panel can handle up to 1024 parameters. Similar
    to 7-bit joystick panels, but offers a double data resolution. Each panel
    can visualize up to 2 areas a time, handling 4 parameters. The number of
    visualized joystick areas can be adjusted by the user for each panel.<BR>
  <LI>
    Each slider panel can be instantly converted into a virtual joystick panel
    and vice-versa, preserving all current parameter values and positions.<BR>
  <LI>
    Each slider (or joystick) of a panel can be moved not only by the mouse,
    but also by incoming MIDI control-change messages. This allows remote control
    of sliders (joysticks). The assignments of each remote MIDI message can be
    freely configured by the user.<BR>
  <LI>
    <I><B>Snapshots</B></I>. All the slider (joystick) positions of each panel
    can be stored into a '<I>snapshot</I>'. Up to 128 snapshots can be created
    in each panel. Each one of these snapshots can be instantly recalled by pushing
    a button. &nbsp;When a snapshot is recalled, all slider positions are updated
    according to the corresponding snapshot content, and all MIDI control-change
    messages, corresponding to the new slider positions, are sent to the MIDI
    OUT port. Each snapshot can be also associated to an incoming MIDI note-on
    or program-change message, in order to allow remote recalling of any snapshot,
    belonging to any panel.<BR>
  <LI>
    <I><B>HVS</B></I> <I><B>(Hyper Vectorial Synthesis)</B></I>. VMCI Plus allows
    to modify hundreds of parameters with a single mouse motion, according to
    a structure configured by the user. This control method is called <I>Hyper
    Vectorial Synthesis Control </I>(see below). Each slider/joystick panel has
    an HVS&nbsp;panel associated to it. In each HVS panel there are two HVS areas:
    a one-dimensional area and a two-dimensional one. Normally the user interacts
    with these areas with the mouse, however a remote MIDI control is possible,
    by assigning the pointer motion inside each area to one or more incoming
    MIDI control-change messages.<BR>
  <LI>
    <B><I>Virtual Keyboard</I></B>. This keyboard looks piano-like, but each
    button can be reconfigured in order to send any &nbsp;kind of MIDI messages.
    The buttons can also activate a snapshot belonging to any slider/joystick
    panel. Each button can be associated to a key of the alphanumeric keyboard,
    as well as to an incoming MIDI message, allowing remote control of events
    joined with each button.

To install MSVC you must follow the next steps:
<OL>
  <LI>
    Download the zipped archive, create a folder named "c:\csound\" and unzip
    the archive in that directory, preserving the directory structure.<BR>
  <LI>
    Create a shortcut of the executable file (VMCI Plus.exe) in the desktop and/or
    in the start menu in order to make it faster to start it.
</OL>
<P>
Here is the installation procedure to use VMCI Plus with DirectCsound:<BR>
<OL>
  <LI>
    If DirectX (version 5.0 or higher) is not already present on your computer,
    then download and Install Microsoft DirectX package. This step isn't necessary
    with Windows 98.<BR>
  <LI>
    Download DirectCsound at the following url:<BR>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    <A HREF="http://www.tiscalinet.it/G-Maldonado/download.htm">http://www.tiscalinet.it/G-Maldonado/download.htm</A><BR>
    then &nbsp;unzip and copy all content of DirectCsound archive in the folder
    named &nbsp;"c:\csound\".<BR>
  <LI>
    Install Hubi's Loopback virtual MIDI device. It is included in the VMCI Plus
    zipped archive. Create a folder named c:\csound\MidiCable\ and unzip the
    content of archive mdlpbk25.zip in that folder. <BR>
    The loopback device must be installed as a device. Here is a quote from the
    installation notes. <BR>
    <BR>
    Windows 95: Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;ControlPanel-&gt;Hardware Continue-&gt;
    [No] -&gt;Continue -&gt; [ Audio/Video/Game Controller ] -&gt;Continue
    -&gt;Diskette -&gt; [ enter the unzipped directory (c:\csound\MidiCable)
    ] ... <BR>
    <BR>
    Then you will see a list with "Hubi's Loopback v250", select this, some OK
    and restart Windows when asked about it.<BR>
    <BR>
    (See Hubi's loopback manual for more information).<BR>
  <LI>
    Create a shortcut to &nbsp;hwmdcabl.exe on the desktop and/or in the start
    menu in order to make it faster to start it.<BR>
  <LI>
    Start VMCI and configure the MIDI port (button "MIDI setup"), the Csound
    Settings (button" CsoundSettings") and start a real-time orc/sco pair to
    test it.<BR>
  <LI>
    OPTIONAL: Download and install MIDI-OX program (available separately; it
