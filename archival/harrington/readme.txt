The Music of Jeff Harrington
ACID BACH: Suite for Quartertone Synthesizer 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My music reflects my interest in music as an expression of drama and of dance.
Tonal and intensely contrapuntal, it is inspired by New Orleans and classical
 music traditions. 

A four movement suite for quartertone electronic instrument.
Composed in 1991, realized 1995 with Csound. Duration: 7 minutes.
An exploration of a scale which divides the octave into 24 equal parts.
Contrapuntal mayhem; not for the nervous!
