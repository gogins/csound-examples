Based on modular synthesis
a la Buchla synths et. al.


The control programs here
all have only one parameter-
duration. Although it is easy
to change this, and I encourage
you to try, this release was
developed with the philosophy
from some of my earliesst
work with computer music in which
the computer is viewed as a
sort of oracle to feed us
with information and not
the other way around. I therefor
found it refreshing to develop a
set of instruments with a wide
variety of behaviors which would
often surprise me with complex
results. The organization of 
this directory is somewhat
different than my PowerPV
distribution which is rather
carefully organized. This is
not to be deliberately confusing,
but to provide an environment
reminiscent of the analog synths
where you're not quite sure
where that extra banana plug
you need went to, and amidst
a tangled confusion of wires,
some strange and appealing
sounds emerge. It is my hope
that others will build csound
instruments and control modules
to interact with the ones provided.
I hope you'll send me the successful
ones so I can include them in
later releases (with proper
attribution of course).

In some cases, I've made it
just about impossible to avoid
severe aliasing. If you use a
lower sampling rate than 44.1K,
this can only improve the effect.
I hope you won't try to change
this. F.R. Moore once said that
using aliasing to acheive musical
effects is like opening a can
with a Volkswagon.
