This is a collection of reverberators
written mostly at UC San Diego during
1989-1990. The initial idea was for me
and a friend to write a bunch of reverberators
and trade them like baseball cards. Unfortunately,
my friend got into convolution and I was left
holding the bag. I'm always happy to get Csound
baseball cards from others however. 

A synopsis of the instruments is given in
REV_INFO. The most mainstream instruments
are rev1, rev11, and multitap. The other
reverberators are a bit more exotic.

I have provided some basic C code to
generate scores for multitap, rev6,
and gator2.

Gator is one of my favorite processors
here. However, you may run into some
problems with more recent versions of
Csound. Specifically, the reson generator
now has a tendency to blow up with center
frequencies > 1000Hz. If you can get a copy
of Princeton version 1.1 [10/89] of Csound,
use it, and you won't run into this problem.
Otherwise, just don't use resonance frequencies
above 1000Hz (grimace). Also, Gator was
initially designed to make use of the CARL
gen function routines, gen4 in particular.
You can get CARL from the cmusic distribution
at ccrma-ftp.stanford.edu if you don't already
have it. The shell scripts gengator and gengator2
here create functions needed by gator and gator2.
I have altered togator.c such that it employs
the Csound gen5 exponential segment generator to
create approximations of these functions.  However, 
I prefer the results from the gen4 functions, so get it 
if you can.

Since I built these instruments several years
ago, I'm not sure I can be too instructive about
the design considerations. However, I would
be glad to get any feedback on these instruments,
or any useful modifications you've made. I have
found these reverberators quite useful over the
years and hope you do too.
