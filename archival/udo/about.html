<h1> About the User-Defined Opcode Database</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a repository of User-Defined Opcodes for the <a href="http://www.csounds.com">Csound</a> music
synthesis software. User-Defined Opcodes are opcodes for Csound created using
  Csound orchestra text. More information about User-Defined Opcodes can be found
  <a href="http://kevindumpscore.com/docs/csound-manual/opcode.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>Using the database to browse and download UDO's does not require registration
  or logging in.</p>
<p>Registration allows users to login and add UDO's, as well as edit or remove
  those which they have added.</p>
<p>This site also includes an RSS feed so end users can monitor when new UDO's
  have been added. (Currently only shows new entries, not modified ones).</p>
<p>If you have any problems or suggestions, please email me here:</p>

<p>Thanks and enjoy!</p>
