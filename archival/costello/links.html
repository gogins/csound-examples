<A HREF="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/csound/frontpage.html">The Csound Frontpage</A> - has links to all things Csound, including the upcoming Csound Book.

<A HREF="http://www.haint.com/synth-diy">Synthesizer Schematics</A> - A small page of interesting analog synthesizer circuits I have on my site.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.patents.ibm.com/">IBM Patent Site</A> - contains full text/images of patents from 1974 to the present date. Very useful for uncovering synthesis techniques that have been obscured by history.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.geofex.com">Geofex</A> - R.G. Keen's site for guitar effects technical information. Contains links to schematics of many fine effects, plus technical articles on the inner workings of many effects. (Note: I contributed the Tychobrahe Octavia schematic, after reverse engineering one of these rare pedals.)
<P>
<A HREF="http://mall.lakes.com/~map/enotes.htm">Electronotes</A> - Information for ordering the <I>Electronotes</I> newsletter. <I>Electronotes</I> is one of the great treasure troves of technical information on music synthesis, both analog and digital. I own the complete set; not cheap, but one of the best investments I have made. Reading <I>Electronotes</I> issues from the early 1970's to today provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in analog synthesizer design, and how this transfers to digital synthesis.

<A HREF="http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/Emusic/Synth-diy/">synth-diy</A> - The synth-diy mailing list. Probably the finest source of technical information on analog synthesis since <I>Electronotes</I>. List members are exceptionally knowledgeable in all things relating to the theory and construction of analog synthesis. Many listmembers have been working on analog synths since the 1970s; some actually designed synths for companies such as Moog. Exceptionally friendly and helpful people.

<A HREF="http://shoko.calarts.edu/~glmrboy/musicdsp/music-dsp.html">music-dsp</A> - A mailing list which I belong to and contribute to. Subject matter is useage of DSP in all musical applications. Rather poor signal-to-noise ratio, but excellent information occasionally surfaces.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.harmony-central.com">Harmony Central</A> - Excellent source of information for all things related to musical technology. Nice lists of links; some useful source code for music DSP.
