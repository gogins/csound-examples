<H4>DESCRIPTION</H4>
Implementations of a second-order, two-pole two-zero bandpass filter with variable frequency response.
<H4>INITIALIZATION</H4>
The optional initialization variables for <B>resonr</B> and <B>resonz</B> are identical to the i-time variables for <B>reson</B>.
<P>
<I>istor</I> - initial disposition of internal data space. Since filtering
incorporates a feedback loop of previous output, the initial status of
the storage space used is significant. A zero value will clear the space;
a non-zero value will allow previous information to remain. The default
value is 0.

<P><I>iscl</I> - coded scaling factor for resonators. A value of 1 signifies
a peak response factor of 1, i.e. all frequencies other than kcf are attenuated
in accordance with the (normalized) response curve. A value of 2 raises
the response factor so that its overall RMS value equals 1. (This intended
equalization of input and output power assumes all frequencies are physically
present; hence it is most applicable to white noise.) A zero value signifies
no scaling of the signal, leaving that to some later adjustment (such as <B>balance</B>). The default value is 0.
<H4>PERFORMANCE</H4>
<B>resonr</B> and <B>resonz</B> are variations of the classic two-pole bandpass resonator (<B>reson</B>). Both <B>resonr</B> and <B>resonz</B> have two zeroes in their transfer functions, in addition to the two poles. <B>resonz</B> has its zeroes located at z = 1 and z = -1. <B>resonr</B> has its zeroes located at +sqrt(R) and -sqrt(R), where R is the radius of the poles in the complex z-plane. The addition of zeroes to <B>resonr</B> and <B>resonz</B> results in the improved selectivity of the magnitude response of these filters at cutoff frequencies close to 0, at the expense of less selectivity of frequencies above the cutoff peak.  <B>resonr</B> and <B>resonz</B> have very close to constant-gain as the center frequency is swept, resulting in a more efficient control of the magnitude response than with traditional two-pole resonators such as <B>reson</B>. <B>resonr</B> and <B>resonz</B> produce a sound that is considerably different from <B>reson</B>, especially for lower center frequencies; trial and error is the best way of determining which resonator is best suited for a particular application.
<P>
<I>asig</I> - Input signal to be filtered.
<P>
<I>kcf</I> - Cutoff or resonant frequency of the filter, measured in cps.
<P>
<I>kbw</I> - Bandwidth of the filter (the cps difference between the upper and lower half-power points).

<H4>TECHNICAL HISTORY</H4>
<B>resonr</B> and <B>resonz</B> were originally described in an article by Julius O. Smith and James B. Angell (<A HREF=#smith>1</A>). Smith and Angell recommended the <B>resonz</B> form (zeros at +1 and -1) when computational efficiency was the main concern, as it has one less multiply per sample, while <B>resonr</B> (zeroes at + and - the square root of the pole radius R) was recommended for situations when a perfectly constant-gain center peak was required. Ken Steiglitz, in a later article (<A HREF=#steiglitz1>2</A>), demonstrated that <B>resonz</B> had constant gain at the true <I>peak</I> of the filter, as opposed to <B>resonr</B>, which displayed constant gain at the pole <I>angle</I>. Steiglitz also recommended <B>resonz</B> for its sharper notches in the gain curve at zero and Nyquist frequency. Steiglitz's recent book (<A HREF=#steiglitz2>3</A>) features a thorough technical discussion of <B>reson</B> and <B>resonz</B>, while Dodge and Jerse's textbook (<A HREF=#dodgejerse>4</A>) illustrates the differences in the response curves of <B>reson</B> and <B>resonz</B>.
