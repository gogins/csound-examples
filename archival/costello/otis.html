<H2>Inspiration</H2>
<B>otis</B> began life as an attempt at a jungle/drum'n'bass song. I was hoping to use Common Music to generate the rapid-fire drums that can be heard in recent tracks by Aphex Twin. Somehow, the end result of my work was a very slow, subdued piece, with the small, scurrying "mouse sounds" being the only vestigal remains of the earlier work.

<H2>Technical Overview</H2>
<P>
Most of the instruments used in <B>otis</B> are fairly straightforward implementations of "classic" computer music techniques: frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, additive synthesis. However, I experimented with a few techniques (additive synthesis using noise-modulated sinusoids, simple granular synthesis) that were not commonly used in the early days of computer music.
<UL>
<LI>The initial "cloud" of sound is a very simple version of asynchronous granular synthesis, in which each "grain" is a windowed sine wave. The pitch and channel placement of each grain is determined by an algorithm written in Common Music. Over the duration of the event, the grains migrate from an entirely random pitch distribution, to a cluster of pitches centered around various octaves of A, E, and G. An extensive introduction to this form of synthesis can be found in <A HREF=#Roads>Roads 1991</A>.
<LI>The "drone" instrument is created with frequency modulation, and incorporates some stereo detuning. Each channel consists of one modulator, and three carriers, set to nearly harmonic pitch ratios (with some slight detuning for beat frequencies). The outputs of the three carriers are mixed together in parallel. 
<LI>The "mouse drum" instrument is another simple FM instrument, with a single carrier/modulator pair set to an inharmonic ratio, and the index of modulation controlled by a decaying exponential function. This sound is controlled by a Common Music algorithm for alternating between various clusters of rhythmic patterns at random. Since most of the patterns utilize very fast tempos (for example, several 64th notes in a row), the result is a very fast "scurrying" sound that plays at quadruple time to the main pulse of the song. This juxtaposition of different metric divisions (e.g. half-time against double-time) is a characteristic of much drum'n'bass music, where the rapid drumbeats contrast with the very slow sine wave bass lines.
<LI>The "tympani" sound is a combination of additive synthesis and ring modulation by noise. Each partial of the tone is a sine wave (using <B>oscili</B>), that is then multiplied by a low-frequency random function generated by <B>randi</B>. The frequency of the random function is one of the parameters controlled by the Common Music score. For lower frequencies of <B>randi</B>, the result is a sound similar to "chorusing." For higher <B>randi</B> frequencies, the result is a somewhat noisy drum sound, that still has a sense of pitch. At lower pitches, this instrument produces an effective orchestral bass drum sound.
<LI>The "train bell" sound utilizes the same techniques as the "tympani" sound, except that the frequency and amplitude of the partials are derived from Jean-Claude Risset's bell sound (described in <A HREF=#DodgeJerse>Dodge and Jerse 1997</A>, pp. 104-5).  I pitched the sound several octaves up, and controlled the base frequency of the bell, and the degree of randomness of the partials, via envelopes in Common Music. With increased noise modulation of the partials, the bell sound becomes "smeared," which gives a sense of Doppler shifting to the sound, as if it was moving rapidly. Of course, the pitch envelope also imparts a sense of motion to the sound - except that the motion that is implied is physically impossible. Some people might find this distracting, but I like the idea of producing sounds that imply motion that could not exist in the physical world. The different partials are staggered in the stereo field, which gives an interesting effect over headphones.
