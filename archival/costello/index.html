<H1>Csound Compositions & Instruments</H1>
<P>
The following compositions & instruments were created by Sean Costello from November of 1998 to October of 1999, except for monkeystretch which is new.  All compositions copyright &copy; 1999 by Sean Costello, except monkeystretch which is copyrighted for 2000. All rights reserved.  
<P>

<B><A HREF="stringphaser.html">stringphaser</A></B> - A recreation of the classic "string ensemble" through a phaser that was heavily used in 1970's electronic music, with a Feedback Delay Network reverb.
<P>
<B><A HREF="choir.html">choir</A></B> - A choir simulation that predates the string ensemble simulation, but is based on a similar concept. Uses <A HREF="resonrz.html">resonz</A> filters to generate formants.
<P>
<B><A HREF="beethoven.html">beethoven</A></B> - Beethoven's 9th, 2nd movement, subjected to various processing: frequency shifting (based on my <A HREF="hilbert.html">hilbert</A> ugen), "barberpole" phasing (using <B>hilbert</B> and <A HREF="allpassn.html">allpassn</A>), and my implementation of the Stautner/Puckette FDN reverb.  

<P>
<B><A HREF="line.html">line</A>, 
<A HREF="surface.html">surface</A>, 
<A HREF="space.html">space</A></B> - Three seperate small compositions, based around the concepts of line, surface, and space (or my interpretations thereof).  All three of the compositions use a single sample - a 1.3 second snippet of William S. Burroughs saying the word <A HREF="http://www.haint.com/sounds/apocalypse.aiff">"Apocalypse"</A> - as the sole sound source. Various combinations of filtering, echo, reverberation, and granular synthesis are used to twist the sample beyond recognition. 
<P>

<B><A HREF="otis.html">otis</A></B> - My first proper Csound composition. Uses simple granular synthesis, additive synthesis of noise-modulated sinusoids, and frequency modulation synthesis. Common Music was used in the generation of the score file - it is <I>enormous</I> (88 KB).
<P>
<B><A HREF="pvguitar.html">pvguitar</A></B> - A steel-string guitar fingerpicking passage, transformed through phase vocoder analysis/resynthesis (using <B>pvadd</B>) into a sound that is vaguely kalimba-esque. 
<P>
<B><A HREF="monkeystretch.wav">monkeystretch</A></B> - Timestretched monkeys. Siamang, even.  (Note: this is a pretty big .wav file - about 10 megs or so.)
<P>
<B><A HREF="gong.mp3">gong</A></B> - A gong sound, using delay lines in a feedback delay network, with passive nonlinear filters in the loops (a la Van Duyne) to create a buildup of harmonic energy. <A HREF="gong.orc">.orc</A>  <A HREF="gong.sco">.sco</A>
<P>
<B><A HREF="intro.mp3">intro</A></B> - The beginning of a composition, in search of the rest of the composition. The first thing I ever did in Csound that sounded good.

The following "pieces" were done at odd moments in my job at <A HREF="http://www.staccatosys.com">Staccato Systems</A>, usually while trying to do something else. Copyright &copy; 2000 by Sean Costello, all rights reserved, and all that.
<P>
<B><A HREF="ghostElectrons.mp3">ghostElectrons</A></B> - While exploring a particular method of making a time-varying reverb, I came across the following sound. I am running white noise into the reverb, and tweaking the controls in real time.
<P>
<B><A HREF="ggggggg.mp3">ggggggg</A></B> - Done late at night, after working all Saturday. This throws in the kitchen sink: a digital sub-octave cross-product generator (modeled after an Electronotes circuit), running into a MoogVCF unit generator, through a frequency shifter set up for barberpole phasing, into a ring modulator that is being LFOed.  Sample rate was set wrong, which accounts for some strange resonances which I like. Again, just tweaking controls in real time.  I really need to figure out better names for my pieces.
