<H1 CLASS="cs">Include files and samples required for compiling instruments</H1>
<P CLASS="left">
	The following packages are needed by various instruments to compile, so it is recommended
	to download and install them. Also, a recent version of Csound is required by many of
	the instruments (a Linux binary that should work is available
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-code"><A HREF="../html/cspatches.html">here</A></SPAN>).
	<BR>
	Additionally, <A HREF="../html/util.html">utilities</A> from this page may be useful,
	although not required for compiling the orc/sco files.
</P>
<P CLASS="left">

	<SPAN CLASS="cs-filename"><A HREF="../archive/include/base_macros-1.2.1.tar.gz">base_macros-1.2.1.tar.gz</A></SPAN> (8567 bytes)
</P>
<P CLASS="left">
	Contains include files with basic macros (get note parameters, create band-limited tables,
	read MIDI controllers, conversions, formant tables, and more) without which most instruments
	will not compile. To install the include files, copy all files with
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-filename">.orc</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="cs-filename">.sco</SPAN> extension
	to <SPAN CLASS="cs-env">INCDIR</SPAN>.

</P>
<P CLASS="left">
	The orc files from this package are needed by many instruments that produce stereo output.<BR>
	<BR>
	There is also a
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-code"><A HREF="../archive/include/Effects.Include-1.1.1.tar.gz">1.1.1</A></SPAN>
	version (8405 bytes) that uses <SPAN CLASS="cs-color2">convolve</SPAN> files for 90 degree
	phase shifters (this allows a linear phase response, and slightly improved sound quality,
	but is unfortunately slower to render). Note that it uses an install script that works only
	on Unix-like systems to generate impulse responses, although
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-color2">convolve</SPAN> files for the 32-bit floats x86 versions of Csound
	can be downloaded from <A HREF="../archive/include/cv_90_shift-1.1.1.x86.float.tar.gz">here</A> (71024 bytes).
	<BR>
	The 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 versions are identical with the exception of the phase shifters, and are
	fully compatible, so you can use any of them.

<P CLASS="left">
	A collection of TR-808 and 909 drum samples, used by some instruments. Installation can be done
	by simply copying the <SPAN CLASS="cs-filename">drums</SPAN> directory to
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-env">SSDIR</SPAN>.
	<BR>
	This sample set is based on <SPAN CLASS="cs-filename">tr909kit.krz</SPAN> and
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-filename">tr808909.krz</SPAN> available from
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-code"><A HREF="ftp://ftp.sweetwater.com/">ftp.sweetwater.com</A></SPAN>,
	and the TR-808 samples by Michael Fischer (see also <A HREF="../html/tr808-1.txt">this</A>

</P>
<P CLASS="left">
	Another set of samples that is useful to have (although not used as frequently as the 808
	and 909 collection). To install the sample files, copy everything from the
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-filename">data</SPAN> subdirectory to
	<SPAN CLASS="cs-env">SSDIR</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="cs-filename">/s770_samples</SPAN>.
