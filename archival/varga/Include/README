include files and macros for spatial stereo sound
=================================================

version 1.1.x

installation:	./install.sh
uninstall:	./uninstall.sh

include files
-------------

spat.h.orc - this file should be included to use macros.

spat_def.h.orc - this file is used internally by spat.h.orc. Do not include it
  from .orc files.

Effects.Header.orc
Delays.include.orc
Plain_Stereo.include.orc
Spatial_Stereo.include.orc
HRTF_Stereo.include.orc - these are included for compatibility with old .orc
  files; these files may not be used together with the new spat.h.orc.

macros
------

There are three types of spatializer macros:

  xxxxStereo: sound source position is set at i-time; input and output
              variables are:
                i_az_: azimuth in degrees
                i_el_: elevation
                i_d_:  distance in meters
                a_:    input signal
                a_L_:  output / left channel
                a_R_:  output / right channel
                The variables i_1_ - i_6_, and a_1_ - a_6_ are also used
                internally.
              Output delay is $DELAYOFFS1 + i_d_/340 seconds (the value of
              $DELAYOFFS1 is 0.02). Amplitude is scaled by 1 / (0.1 + i_d_).
  xxxxStereoDyn: sound source position can be changed at k-rate; variables
              are the same as in the case of xxxxStereo, but all i-rate
              variables are now k-rate.
  xxxxStereoDynHQ: same as xxxxStereoDyn, but with higher interpolation
              quality. Uses more memory and slower.

xxxx can be:

    Mono: mono output (a_L_ = a_R_)
    Base: intensity stereo
    Spat: simulates a pair of microphones
    UHJ_: output is in UHJ format
    Phse: stereo with +/- 90 degrees phase shift (similar to UHJ)
    HRTF: binaural sound using HRTFs. The HRTF macros have some limitations:
          sample rate is fixed to 44100 Hz, room simualtion is not supported,
          elevation has to be at least -40 degrees, and ksmps has to be a power
          of two value not more than 64. Additional limitations of
          HRTFStereoDyn and HRTFStereoDynHQ: k_az_, k_el_, and k_d_ has to be
          set at i-time with the init opcode, and only one instance of these
          macros can be used in an instrument. HRTF macros also use more temp
          variables: a_1_ - a_7_, k_1_ - k_7_, and i_1_ - i_7_.

Room parameters are set in ftable 225 (see documentation of spat3d opcode).
