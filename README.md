## Examples and Tests for Csound

This repository contains example compositions, some test compositions and 
programs, and extensions that can be used with [csound](https://github.com/csound/csound), 
[csound-extended](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended), 
[csound.node](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended/tree/develop/csound.node), 
[WebAudio Csound](https://github.com/csound/csound/tree/develop/Emscripten),
[csound-extended-wasm](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended/tree/develop/WebAssembly), 
and the [Csound for Android](https://github.com/gogins/csound-android) app.

These pieces are segregated by directories named by programming language or 
Csound runtime environment.

The unit tests used in the canonical build of Csound are _not_ included here.

For more information, please read the examples themselves.

PLEASE NOTE! Not all of these examples or tests actually work. Some are of 
archival interest only.
