## Examples and Tests for Csound

This repository contains example compositions, and some test compositions and 
programs, that can be used with csound, csound-extended, csound.node, Csound 
for WebAssembly, and Csound for Android.

These pieces are segregated by directories named by programming language or 
Csound runtime platform.

The unit tests used in the canonical build of Csound are not included here.

For more information, please read the examples themselves.
