## Examples and Tests for Csound

This repository contains example compositions, some test compositions and 
programs, and extensions that can be used with: 
 - The canonical release of [csound](https://github.com/csound/csound). 
 - The canonical [WebAudio Csound](https://github.com/csound/csound/tree/develop/Emscripten).
 - My [csound-aeolus](https://github.com/gogins/csound-aeolus) opcodes.
 - [My collection of extensions for Csound including CsoundAC for algorithmic composition](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended). 
 - My [csound.node](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended/tree/develop/csound.node) for NW.js.
 - My [csound-extended-wasm](https://github.com/gogins/csound-extended/tree/develop/WebAssembly) including Csound and CsoundAC for WebAssembly. 
 - My [Csound VST3 opcodes](https://github.com/gogins/csound-vst3-opcodes).
 - My [Csound for Android](https://github.com/gogins/csound-android) app.

These pieces are more or less segregated by directories named by programming 
language or Csound runtime environment.

The unit tests used in the canonical build of Csound are _not_ included here.

For more information, please read the examples themselves.

### Please note!

Not all of these examples or tests actually work. Some are of archival 
interest only.

Many of these examples are included in some of my other Git repositories, 
so please do not rename or move files or directories. 

Please feel free to contribute new pieces, examples, or extensions by pull 
request.
